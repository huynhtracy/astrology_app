  'Money matters will be far more important now to you than to anyone else, even if you\'re trying to work out a partnership. Does this mean you should let someone else take charge? No way. Be even more diligent.',
  'You may start out that long-distance chat with the intention of catching up. But after you\'re done with all the good memories, make a graceful exit before the conversation takes an uncomfortable turn. Easy, now.',
  'The stars are feeling sexy. Get ready for a long, lingering afternoon and evening. If you\'re attached, have lunch and dinner delivered. If you\'re not, put on your cutest outfit and get out there.',
  'Anyone with an opinion different from yours will automatically be seen by you as the opponent -- and in some instances, you may be right. Just don\'t assume that everyone is automatically on the other side.',
  'If tonight doesn\'t find you in the arms of someone delicious, it won\'t be for lack of trying on your part. This is the perfect astrological recipe for candlelight, romance and holding hands. Don\'t worry about the time.',
  'You may not mean for it to happen, but your words could hurt someone, even if you\'re trying to be restrained. Better take a mediator along. Just in case.',
  'A coworker who\'s asked you for help may be involved with something that could end up being a serious problem. If your antennae start to twitch, back out. Immediately.',
  'Family matters are draining and work hasn\'t exactly been a piece of cake, either. Still, you\'re proud of what you\'ve accomplished. You wouldn\'t trade one minute for a day in the Bahamas.',
  'A group you\'ve been privately associating with will soon ask you to take the show on the road -- in short, for help of a far more public nature. If you\'re ready, fine. If not, don\'t you dare feel guilty about saying no.',
